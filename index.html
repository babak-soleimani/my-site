    I work across <strong>music, spatial research, and cultural analysis</strong>. My practice is concerned
    with how interiors shape listening — how light, surfaces, and arrangement can expand or
    compress the sense of presence between bodies.

    I perform with AgawDilim, a project that blends modal improvisation, microtonal drift,
    and rhythmic architectures influenced by jazz and regional classical traditions.

    Parallel to performance, I study the <strong>design histories of cafes and social rooms</strong>.
    Using open data (Yelp), I map the shift from intimate, shadowed “nook” interiors to the
    contemporary “airspace” aesthetic — the global coffee-shop interior of bright walls,
    hanging plants, and laptop-compatible neutrality.

    I am interested in how aesthetic forms circulate through global supply networks, how style
    encodes class aspiration, and how listening can be used as a way of reading architecture.
